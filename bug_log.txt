Checkpoint 1 bugs:

Bug #1:
    Problem: We were still boot - looping as we were working on loading the idt
    What was the issue: We realized we weren't calling lidt
    What we did: we called lidt(idt_desc_ptr) after the handlers in the idt

Bug #2:
    Problem: The keyboard interrupt is detected but when we try to press a key repeatedly, it does not print every time we press/unpress. 
    What was the issue: In the handler, we forgot to read from the keyboard data port so it wasn't sending the next interrupt. 
    What we did: we added inb(0x60) in the keyboard handler.

Bug #3:
    Problem: Our paging wasn't working 
    What was the issue: We did the wrong offset because we were overthinking the entire thing with initializing the paging
    What we did: we changed the offset for page_director[1] to 0x40000 | 0x193
